## What is this?

This repo contains a starter template for making single page apps (SPAs).
You can both preview and build the actual application within this repo.
I use it to enable rapid development of SPAs, so that I don't have to remember how to add tailwind, Router, etc.

## Purpose and Summary

The primary framework is [Vue](https://vuejs.org).
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is used to assist in fast development of the application.

	* Typescript ([why?](https://www.typescriptlang.org/why-create-typescript))
	* TailwindCSS ([why?](https://cleancommit.io/blog/why-we-use-tailwind-css-as-our-primary-framework/))
	* Vue is written using the modern and scalable composition API

Keep in mind that:

	* Any styles need to have the postcss attribute: `<style lang="postcss">`

## Quick start

As usual, commands can be viewed in `package.json` under _scripts_.

For example:

	* To preview the site at `localhost:3333`, run `npm run dev` from the command line.
	* To build the site at , run `npm run build`. The completed project will live under `/dist`.
